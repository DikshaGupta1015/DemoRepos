          MVC Training (Day 2)
=================================================

*Web services allows us to use create SOAP services

*Web API allows to use Restful services, http services

*Model contains data and its processing logic

*Drawback of ASP .Net
 -Unnecessary loading of page lifecycle
 -No control over html
 -It does not support methods for http

*Methods for http are get,put,post,delete

*In ASP .Net MVC request is received by Controllers.

*After the Controller receives the request, it finds if we need data, view or part of view

*SPA-Single Page Application.

*In SPA a Page is initially loaded, data is retrieved using Web API, partial pages are loaded, and this reduces flickering.

*AJAX is the method by which partial pages are uploaded and this process takes place in an asynchronous way.

*ASP .Net MVC - server side

*SPA - client side.

*SPA can be developed using Javascript.
